# (Task 3) Managing Service Plans for Customers

Plans offer customers a variety of service options defined within a preconfigured framework.

Please note that following the recent feature implementation, adjustments to your customer service workflows and solutions may be necessary due to a system update. Specifically, user records now include additional properties, detailed in the latest version of our API reference. For instance, users may transition to an 'idle' state before confirming a plan purchase.

The number of plans per provider is now unlimited, allowing you to create and customize as many plans as needed. Each plan maps to specific user attributes and adheres to the corresponding state's limitations.
